# Insurechain
Insurechain is a hybrid blockchain which enables seamless porting of the policies between different vendors, allowing interoperability and interaction between various private chains.

## Idea behind Insurechain
1. Hybrid blockchain includes benefits of both the openness of a public blockchain and restriction of a private network by limiting the access to join a network
2. Private networks generate the record of transactions which are stored and verified on the public blockchain. These help in faster transaction speeds, privacy of the data.
3. Insurechain is a solution which allows the enterprise to maintain a layer of privacy, along with scalability of transactions. Not only this, enterprises can take advantage of existing public blockchain, ethereum in this case, for security and validation. 
4. This helps the enterprise get the scalability of transactions like private network by building on sidechain by Matic, validate transactions through a trust-minimized network by using public checkpointing validators and get benefit of Ethereum public chain’s security.

## Public Blockchain Architecture
The basic working architecture of the public Matic Network chain can be studied here. However, here we take a step further and provide flexibility to what can be built on Matic Network. Apart from the public sidechain, we can build an enterprise sidechain or optimistic rollup sidechain or any other sidechain that wants to interact with the existing public architecture of Matic Network and benefit from the security provided by a public chain such as ethereum.

## Insurance portability using public Blockcahin
Ethereum, the world’s first fully-fledged smart-contract platform, provides exciting propositions. It is in fact Ethereum that is leading the innovation in the public blockchain domain and is being explored in a multitude of application areas.
Application on Ethereum are making huge progress but the current blockchain ecosystem is not prepared to scale as per the demand because of slow block confirmations and high gas fees.


Matic Network solves the above problems by building a decentralized platform using an adapted version of Plasma framework that provides a solution for faster and extremely low-cost transactions with finality on the main chain.


The following things happen on the public blockchain in the InsureChain Portal
1. Basic identifiable details of the customers
2. Basic identifiable details of the vendors
3. Metadata for NFTs\
  - Meta details of the policies.\
  - Details regarding the portability (When, from which vendor to which vendor the policies was ported)
4. Claims\
   - Hashes of the claims
